what is masking ?
ans : Masking involves setting some of the pixel values in an image to zero,
      or some other "background" value.
      -Masks or filters can also be used for edge detection in an image and to
       increase sharpness of an image
what are edges?
ans : We can also say that sudden changes of discontinuities in an image are called
      as edges. Significant transitions in an image are called as edges  

masking/filtering  can be used for blurring and edge detection in image 
-blurring: we simple blur image.
-edge detection: detect edges


NOTE:::All the masks that are used for edge detection are also known as derivative masks.
       Because as we have stated many times before in this series of tutorials that image 
       is also a signal so changes in a signal can only be calculated using differentiation. 
       So that’s why these operators are also called as derivative operators or derivative masks

//*********
All the derivative masks should have the following properties:

-Opposite sign should be present in the mask.
-Sum of mask should be equal to zero.
-More weight means more edge detection.

mask operations:
-sobel: calculates edges in both horizontal and vertical direction.
-prewitt: Prewitt operator is used for detecting edges horizontally and vertically.
--difference b/w sobel and prewitt :The major difference is that in sobel operator the coefficients 
    of masks are not fixed and they can be adjusted according to our requirement unless they do not
    violate any property of derivative masks.
-laplacian: second order derivative mask
            -unlike other operators Laplacian didn’t take out edges in any particular
             direction but it take out edges in following classification.
             --Inward edges(-ve laplacian)(center element should be positive)
              0 -1 0 
             -1 4 -1
              0 -1 0
             --outward edges(+ve laplacian)(center element should be -ve)
             0 1  0
             1 -4 1
             0 1  0
